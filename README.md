# About this project
I started this project a few months ago and it really isn't hard or anything.
I just got busy with work and university. 
It is at its very first stage and will grow alot overtime. 
I started this for a code challenge on MakingGamesWithBen's youtube. the link to the video is:

I am learning game-dev concepts and I know C++ more than this projects prerequisites. but its still fun to do.

# The future
Its always fun to get creative with simple ideas so if you have any cool idea for this project feel free to contact me
